 Final Project: build a quality static website
 #CFG-Team 1 
 > This is the final assignament from Team 5 as part of the Code First Girls Web Development course #ck22intiqh

 This website was created by  Ipek, Carmen, and Vic as a collaborative project.  

 Mission: the website is the initial proposal for a web platform that includes a Travel Agency/ Social Hub for Digital Nomads. 
 
    Having a platform that includes Services and Social options to be part of virtual (and live) communities where the user could feel welcome from day zero. Spaces where you can find networking connections, skill shares, and co-working places. No more awkwardness when you are the new face in the city!

 ***This is a demo-static site, there is no backend to support real-live searches. Educational purpose only-does not include commercial, professional or any other for-profit purposes***

 ## Creating Digital Nomad Life website

 1. On the first sprint of the project, we pitched our ideas. Then we defined the must/nice to have(s) items from user's requirements and project goal(s)
 2. We worked with Figma to create the website wireframe
 3. Ipek designed the Brand-name/logo and she brought the initial vision of this project
 4. Carmen created our management system on Notion a space to track the documentation/sources during the project 
 5. Vic work on the Design System and the some UX-basic navigation elements on the screens (navbar and footer)
 
 Each member of the team was responsible to develop 2 pages of the project: 
  - Login and Profile -> Carmen
  - Landing and Results -> Vic
  - Communities and About Us -> Ipek
 We worked together developing consistent styling (+Flexbox + Bootstrap) between pages. 
 When it was possible we also included JavaScript events to make the website interactive:
  - Forms- submit 
  - Buttons- onclick elements (redirect/links) 
  - Button- go back (web history)
  - Footer- "Team 5" toogle (pop-up)
